Build various ML-models to detect the presence of Heart Disease in an Individual. Based on the accuracy provided by the various models, the best model is used for final prediction.

The dataset used is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease 

The actual dataset contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.

Proposed Methodolgy :
Proposed Methodology starts with the collection of the data. For this the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset is downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which is well verified by a number of researchers and authority of the UCI.

And then based on the accuracy provided by the various ML- Algorithms, the best algorithm is chosen for the final prediction
